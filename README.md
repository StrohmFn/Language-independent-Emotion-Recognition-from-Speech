# Language-independent Emotion Recognition from Speech

Goal of this project ist to develop a network, that identifies the in voice expressed
emotion in given speech independent of the language that is spoken. We are especially
interested in the effects of training a network either solely based on one language and
train both languages individually or having cross-language training and thus not dif-
ferentiating the input language in our corpus. Therefore, our baseline will differentiate
between these two methods for all three research questions.
